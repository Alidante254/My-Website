                            this chat app is designed to filter out offensive language and prevent users from sending messages containing bad words. It likely uses a filter system that detects and flags messages containing inappropriate language before they are sent. When a message with a bad word is detected, the system may automatically replace the offending word with asterisks or other symbols or prevent the message from being sent altogether. This feature can help create a more positive and respectful environment within the chat community and promote more appropriate and civil conversations.
